## My process
Made this mobile design having user interface for chats from scratch with core html, css and bootstrap.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap (grid sysytem)

### What I learned

I learnt overflow:hidden property in css to hide the scrollbar. Also i got to practice more over Bootstrap grid system for
responsive layout designs. Designing the mobile and its user interface from scratch was bit challenging and i truly enjoyed while
working on it.
Further i'm looking to add few more stuff like animations and all.


### Useful resources
**w3schools helped me a lot in getting familiar with lots of CSS properties and while working with Bootstrap5**
